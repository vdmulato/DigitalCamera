# DigitalCamera
This is the place where we are going to follow up with weekly updates of the project

Week 1 (Jan 9 - Jan 14) 
First design with considerations taken on what parts to use for prototypes and final product. Ordering of the parts. Refer to week 1 slides for more information.
Week 2 (Jan 15 - Jan 21)
Start of prototype V0 the goal of this prototype is to familiarize ourselves with the Psoc enviroment and ADC implementation. For this first prototype we will be using 
a single photoresistor and read its value. Basically we will be building a ohmmeter this will help us to be familiar with the code for the next step of implementing the
multiplexers with an array of photoresistors.
